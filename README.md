This project was done in the Scope of my Microcontrollers course in my University. It wass created for the ARM M4 Cortex architecture and was tested on the Texas Instruments TM4C1294 Microcontroller.

The program samples the built-in Temperature sensor in port E of the Microcontroller. This is done 4 times, where the average of the 4 values is calculated and displayed to the user. This process is repeated in an infinte loop, in 1 second intervals, which are set by usinga timer.
